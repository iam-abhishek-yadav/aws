## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

Amazon EC2 is a cloud-based web service that offers secure and scalable compute capacity. It provides on-demand infrastructure with a commitment to 99.99% availability and incorporates security features through the AWS Nitro System. Optimization options include AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.

### Applications of EC2:

EC2 addresses various needs such as secure, reliable, and cost-effective compute infrastructure, on-demand infrastructure for efficient HPC applications, rapid environment setup with dynamic capacity scaling, and pay-as-you-go pricing, as well as diverse compute, networking, and storage services for ML projects.

### Variety in EC2 Instance Types:

- **General Purpose:** Balanced allocation of compute, memory, and network resources, suited for tasks like web servers, small databases, and development environments.
- **Compute Optimized:** Emphasizes a higher compute power to memory ratio, ideal for demanding workloads such as batch processing, scientific modeling, and gaming servers.
- **Memory Optimized:** Tailored for memory-intensive workloads, suitable for applications requiring large memory, like in-memory databases and real-time analytics.
- **Storage Optimized:** Optimized for tasks involving high, sequential read and write access to large datasets, ideal for data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.

### Additional Capabilities:

- **Processor Types:** a – AMD processors, g – AWS Graviton processors, i – Intel processors
- **Other Capabilities:** d – Instance store volumes, n – Network and EBS optimized, e – Extra storage or memory, z – High performance

### EC2 Instance Families:

Instance families categorize EC2 instances based on specific characteristics. Some notable families include:

- **C – Compute**
- **D – Dense storage**
- **F – FPGA**
- **G – GPU**
- **Hpc – High-performance computing**
- **I – I/O**
- **Inf – AWS Inferentia**
